Note: No special credentials needed to test site. To run application register, login, and create/delete horses.

Unique code to highlight
As part of our original project goal we hoped to generate a race between horses. The horses chances of winning is based on the horses' statistics. In our project folder there is a 'racing' folder with the start of that code.
